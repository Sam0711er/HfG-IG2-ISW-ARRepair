Hey, welcome to **ARRepair**!

Repairing computers and smartphones isn't easy. Nowadays, a lot of critical and complex components are built into these devices and while you might only want to replace your display or hard drive, it's entirely possible you might accidentally destroy some other component while in the replacement process. ARRepair wants to make replacing and repairing components easier. It is an AR guide that you can use on your device in order to better understand instructions of the dis-/assembly process.

This specific ARRepair tutorial shows you how to replace the hard drive of a 27" iMac. It was created in a workshop of the International Seminar Week 2018 at [HfG Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend). A demo video is available over [here](https://youtu.be/89siVpELS94).


## Setup & Usage

1. Open the image 'Sierra.jpg' and view it in fullscreen or set it as desktop wallpaper on your iMac
2. Download the Zappar app ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zappar/id429885268), [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zappar.Zappar)) on your phone and launch it.
3. Scan the Zapcode below
4. Point your phone towards the iMac (I recommend landscape)
5. Have fun! üòÄüéâ
